FPGA

Author - Michael Fallon

This is a repository to keep track of my FPGA projects.

It is divided into three main sections
  
  - Primitives: this is for simple hdl files that are useful for bigger designs

  - Projects: this is for more involved projects that get put on hardware

  - Test code: This is a python package for cocotb bfms and test modules
