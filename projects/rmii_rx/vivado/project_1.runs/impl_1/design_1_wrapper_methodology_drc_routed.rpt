2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2 and rmii_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2] -to [get_clocks rmii_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks rmii_rx_clk and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rmii_rx_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2 and rmii_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2] -to [get_clocks rmii_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks rmii_rx_clk and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rmii_rx_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rmii_rx_data[0] relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rmii_rx_data[1] relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rmii_rx_data[2] relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rmii_rx_data[3] relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rmii_rx_dv relative to clock(s) rmii_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} -add [get_ports sys_clk] (Source: C:/Users/mfall/Desktop/sandbox/projects/rmii_rx/constraints/arty_constraints.xdc (Line: 10))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports sys_clk] (Source: c:/Users/mfall/Desktop/sandbox/projects/rmii_rx/vivado/project_1.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/ip/design_1_clk_wiz_0_2/design_1_clk_wiz_0_2.xdc (Line: 56))
